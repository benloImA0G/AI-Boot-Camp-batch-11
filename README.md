## 📌 Overview

**ResumeFit AI** is an end-to-end AI application that helps job seekers understand exactly why their CV isn't passing ATS (Applicant Tracking System) filters — and gives them actionable steps to fix it.

Most job seekers send generic CVs without knowing which keywords are missing, which skills are misaligned, or why the wording isn't landing. ResumeFit AI solves this with a **4-layer hybrid AI scoring engine** that combines statistical NLP, semantic vector search, and generative AI into a single, easy-to-use app.

|---|---|
| 🎯 **ATS Match Score** | Overall CV-to-JD compatibility score (0–100%) |
| 📊 **4-Layer Hybrid Scoring** | TF-IDF + Pinecone Semantic + Keyword Coverage + Skill Match |
| 🗄️ **Vector Database Matching** | Semantic similarity via Pinecone — captures meaning, not just keywords |
| 🔍 **12-Aspect CV Evaluation** | LLM-powered deep analysis across 12 quality dimensions |
| ⚡ **Impact Language Analysis** | Detects weak verbs, buzzwords, and missing quantified achievements |
| 📋 **ATS Formatting Check** | Flags multi-column layouts, images, tables, missing sections |
| 🤖 **AI CV Rewrite** | Smart rewrite: tailors CV if match ≥60%, enhances overall quality if <60% |

## 🧬 Vector Embedding Pipeline

ResumeFit AI uses **Pinecone** as its vector database to enable semantic (meaning-based) matching between a CV and a job description — going beyond keyword overlap to understand conceptual similarity.

### How It Works — Step by Step

```
Job Description Text
        │
        ▼
[ Sentence Transformer Model ]
  all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (local, free)
  384-dimensional dense vector
        │
        ▼
[ Pinecone Upsert ]
  Index: resumefit-index
  Metric: Cosine Similarity
  Dimension: 384
  Store JD as "jd-vector"
        │
        ▼
CV Text → [ Sentence Transformer Model ] → 384-dim vector
        │
        ▼
[ Pinecone Query ]
  CV vector queried against stored JD vector
        │
        ▼
[ Cosine Similarity Score ]
  Scaled 0–100% → Pinecone Semantic Score (30% of Final Score)
```

### Technical Details

| Component | Value |
|---|---|
| **Embedding Model** | `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` |
| **Vector Dimensions** | 384 |
| **Similarity Metric** | Cosine Similarity |
| **Vector Database** | Pinecone Serverless |
| **Index Name** | `resumefit-index` |
| **Input Limit** | First 2,000 characters of each text |
| **Model Source** | HuggingFace (downloaded once per session, ~80MB) |

### Why Pinecone + Embeddings?

Traditional ATS systems match keywords literally — "managed" won't match "led" even though they mean the same thing. By encoding both the CV and JD into dense vector embeddings, ResumeFit AI captures **semantic meaning**: synonyms, related concepts, and contextual relevance all contribute to the score. Pinecone stores and queries these vectors at scale with sub-second latency.

---

## 📐 Scoring Formula

ResumeFit AI uses a **weighted hybrid formula** combining 4 layers:

```
Final Score = 0.4 × TF-IDF  +  0.3 × Pinecone  +  0.2 × Keywords  +  0.1 × Skills
```

| Component | Weight | Method |
|---|---|---|
| TF-IDF Cosine Similarity | 40% | `sklearn` TfidfVectorizer + cosine similarity |
| Pinecone Semantic Similarity | 30% | `sentence-transformers` embeddings + Pinecone vector search |
| Keyword Coverage | 20% | `∣KJ ∩ KR∣ / ∣KJ∣ × 100` |
| Skill Match | 10% | Rule-based dictionary matching |

> **Score Guide:** 🟢 75–100% Excellent &nbsp;|&nbsp; 🔵 55–75% Good &nbsp;|&nbsp; 🟡 35–55% Moderate &nbsp;|&nbsp; 🔴 0–35% Needs Work

### 🎯 Why These Weights?

The weights were deliberately chosen to **mirror how real-world ATS systems actually work**, not to maximise pure semantic accuracy:

- **TF-IDF at 40%** — Most commercial ATS platforms (Workday, Taleo, Greenhouse) are predominantly keyword-matching engines. Giving TF-IDF the highest weight accurately simulates their behaviour.
- **TF-IDF + Keyword Coverage = 60% combined** — This reflects the industry reality that ATS screening is still largely keyword-driven. A CV that shares vocabulary with the JD is more likely to pass automated filters.
- **Pinecone Semantic at 30%** — Adds modern NLP intelligence. Captures meaning and conceptual alignment beyond exact keyword matches — representing the direction ATS is evolving toward.
- **Skill Match at 10%** — Acts as a focused signal on top of keyword coverage, specifically targeting technical and soft skills that recruiters explicitly filter on.

> This is a deliberate design decision to simulate ATS behaviour accurately, not a limitation. A purely semantic model would score CVs differently from how real ATS systems do.

## 🧗 Challenges & Learnings

Building ResumeFit AI end-to-end surfaced several real-world AI engineering challenges:

| # | Challenge | Solution | Learning |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Pinecone cold-start latency** — vector ingestion caused noticeable delays with no user feedback | Added real-time spinners and status messages during each ingestion step | User feedback during processing matters as much as final accuracy |
| 2 | **Inconsistent LLM output formatting** — Groq responses often broke the parser with unexpected structures | Strict prompt engineering with exact labeled output templates (`ASPECT:`, `SCORE:`, `TIP:`) | Structured prompts with explicit field names dramatically improve parsing reliability |
| 3 | **Image-based PDF parsing failures** — many real CVs use graphics, icons, and photo headers that PyPDF cannot extract | Built a dedicated ATS format checker that detects and warns users about image-heavy CVs before scoring | Detection of bad inputs is as valuable as the scoring itself |
| 4 | **Low-match CV force-fitting** — early versions tried to tailor every CV to the job regardless of match quality, producing dishonest rewrites | Implemented a dual strategy: tailor CV if score ≥60%, enhance overall quality if <60% without forcing the fit | AI should be honest with users, not just compliant with their requests |
| 5 | **Groq free-tier rate limits** — LLM calls occasionally hit rate limits mid-analysis, breaking the pipeline | Built a complete rule-based fallback engine that activates automatically when the LLM is unavailable | Every AI feature in a production app needs a reliable non-AI fallback |

## 🔄 Future Roadmap

| Version | Features |
|---|---|
| **V2.0** | Multi-job comparison, full Bahasa Indonesia support |
| **V3.0** | Job recommendation engine, CV auto-template generation |
